# ECA-Registration-System
This project is a registration system for ECA students. The students can register for events organized by the ECA, while the admins of the ECA and students can view the registered participants. The login page is used to login a student. If student is selected, the registration form for the event appears. If "view participants" is clicked on the login page, a webpage with the registered students is displayed.
# How it works
The login page first checks whether the ID that was input by the user is that of an ECA student or not. If it is not, it informs the user they must be an ECA student to enter. If the entered ID is that of an ECA student, it redirects to a registration page. Here students can register for a chosen event. If an invalid email or id is input, an error message is displayed asking for valid input. When they input information, it is saved to be displayed if the admin option is chosen. This option displays the registered students information for each event.
