# ECA-Registration-System
This project is a registration system for ECA students. The students can register for events organized by the ECA, while the admins of the ECA can view the registered students.The login page is used to enter an admin or a student. If student is selected, the registration form for the event appears and if admin is chosen the registered students are displayed.
# How it works
The login page first checks whether the ID that was input by the user is that of an ECA student or not. If it is not, it informs the user they must be an ECA student to enter. If the entered ID is that of an ECA student and the student option is chosen, it redirects to a registration page. Here students can register for the chosen event. When they input information, it is saved to be displayed if the admin option is chosen. This option displays the registered students information for each event.
